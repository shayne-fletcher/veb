[PRESERVING ORDER IN A FOREST IN LESS THAN LOGARITHMIC TIME](https://users.cs.utah.edu/~pandey/courses/cs6968/spring23/papers/veb.pdf).

"We present a data structure, based upon a stratified binary tree, which enables us to manipulate online a priority queue whose priorities are selected
from the interval I ... n, with an average and worst case processing time of O(log log n) per instruction. The structure is used to obtain a mergeable heap whose time requirements are about as good."
